On kickoff we waited in suspense for the drop and First delivered. We wrote up our list of priorities, made a discussion board for ideas, and disbanded for the day with songs in our heads. Our music-themed challenge gave us a lot of ideas for robots, and we spent the second half of kickoff brainstorming how we could get in tune and hit the right notes. During the build season, we designed and utilized a large number of 3d printed parts on our robot and engineered effective quick-swap bumpers. Those combined earned us the Industrial Design award at Glacier Peak for the second time in a row. At Glacier Peak, we were the first backup bot, and against all odds, we were substituted in on the second out of three finals matches when Team 360 had to make emergency repairs. When 360 was done, the alliance won the final round and brought the now alliance of four a blue banner! All of us on ChainLynx are extremely grateful for this season and have prepared to better manage our time and resources next season for the upcoming water games.

We started the season on a full battery following our most successful season so far. We got our CNC router at the start of the year and were prepared to use it for the new season. Kickoff was full of excitement for our first pick-and-place game in a long time. We created a unique design with an elevator and a four-bar system. For the first time, we implemented our drivetrain with Swerve. With this design, we were awarded the Industrial Design Award by FIRST WA. We made a lot of technical and team advancements this year and have been preparing for the 2023-2024 season.

This year, our team had our first competition in 2 years. The Rapid React challenge focused on mobility and transportation. The team grew by an order of magnitude after great recruitment efforts. We competed in 2 competitions and won the Entrepreneurship Award and the Gracious Professionalism Award. We speedily made it to the District Championship for the first time alongside many older and established teams. We focused on organizing the team and wrote our first official constitution to prepare us for our future as a larger, more skillful team.

In the face of an unprecedented virus - Covid-19 - our school went fully online, and our club with it. Unable to work on a robot, we dedicated this year to outreach, branding, and online competitions held by FIRST® (see: [Game Design](/about#game-design), Innovation challenge).

Our founding year, we created the basics of our club structure. Full of students new to robotics, we were passionate about learning the basics. During this year we created the basis of our club structure, our first robot, and competed in our first competition.

Our team’s first-ever robot was the ‘AT-AT’ (a table - a table). This robot heavily incorporates the use of wood in its design. While uncommon, this allowed us to utilize resources we already had access to so we could focus our attention on more pressing matters such as learning how to code and use power tools. We also had the generous support of materials and teaching from Viking Robotics and the Iron Riders.
